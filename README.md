# EPA’s Avoided Emissions and Generation Tool (AVERT)

The AVERT app is really two separate apps:    
The [front-end app](/epa-avert-webapp), and [web server app](/epa-avert-webservice).

The front-end app is ultimately built to static files, which are served by the web server app on [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/). In addition to serving the front-end app, the web server app is responsible for performing displacement calculations, and returning that data to the front-end app for display.

View each app’s README for more info on the local development and deployment processes of each app.
